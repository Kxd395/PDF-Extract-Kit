        Initializes a Table Processor object.
        It takes an optional `config_path` parameter which specifies the path to a configuration file.
        If no `config_path` is provided, the default configuration will be used.
        This method also initializes a logger and loads the configuration.
        It calls the `_init_tr_model` method to initialize the table recognition model.

        Attributes:
        - logger: The logger instance for logging debug and error messages.
        - config: The configuration object that stores the loaded configuration from the provided path.
        - tr_model: The initialized text recognition model.

        Methods:
        - __init__(self, config_path: str = None): Initializes an instance of the software with the provided configuration path.
        - _init_tr_model(self): Initializes the text recognition model.

        Parameters:
        - img_list: a list of images to perform table recognition on

        Returns:
        - A modified version of doc_layout_result with table recognition results added

        The method initializes the table recognition process and sets the maximum time for the recognition.
        It then iterates through each image in img_list and retrieves the layout details for that image from doc_layout_result.

        For each layout detail, if the category_id is 5 (indicating that it is a table),
        the method crops the image based on the polygon coordinates of the layout detail and performs table recognition on the cropped image.

        The table recognition operation might take significant time,
        so a timeout check is performed to determine if the recognition process exceeds the maximum time.
        If it does, the timeout flag is set to True in the layout detail.

        The recognized LaTeX output is assigned to the "latex" property of the layout detail.

        Finally, the method logs the completion of the table recognition process and returns the modified doc_layout_result.
